## The beginning

"Wait."


What was that?


As I was scrolling down my Instagram feed on a Monday afternoon, a reel caught my attention.

"She is hot af."

I bit my lip as I said that to myself. Was it actually a girl that I was interested in?
Ha you wish it was. I only saw a beautiful piece of red meat being oiled in to the pan and sizzled as it got wetter.

As the thyme, rosemary, and butter entered to the pan as the meat switched her position, I couldn't stop myself from drooling.

"God damn, where can I find her?"

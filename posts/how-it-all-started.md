## Who is she?

"Wait."

What was that?

As I was scrolling down my Instagram feed on a Monday afternoon, a reel caught my attention.

"She is hot af."

I bit my lip as I said that to myself. Was it actually a girl that I was interested in?
Ha you wish it was. I only saw a beautiful piece of red meat being oiled in to the pan and making sizzle noises as white smoke rose.

Thyme, rosemary, and butter entered the pan after the meat was flipped, my saliva were running down from the side of my lips.

"God damn, where can I get her?"

It didn't take long to open my Google Maps and find the nearest Trader Joe's. Did you know, Trader Joe's always sell by small batches for single or double households?

After a long hauls of my research and comparing, Trader Joe's has the best value in my criteria of judgment. If you ever get interested in cooking, check them out if they are near you. Because I am not getting paid to give them promotions.

## The boring truth

I hope you really didn't believe that above story is why I got into cooking. No, it all started because of my father.

My parents sent me to Seattle from Seoul in 2007. I was told that it was just a 'visit' to my grandparents because my dads side of the family were all located in Washington state. A 10 year old me knew nothing about United States. No wonder my mom forced me to take English classes and even give me the name 'Ray.'

I was happy with one thing though. My father learned a spaghetti dish that I can never forget the taste of. I still remember it was a blended mix of red bell pepper, tofu, tomato paste, and other ingredients. It was a one of a kind spaghetti dish. Never have I tasted anything similar ever.

Do I know how to make the dish? No. Maybe one day, I will get to learn from him.

## Motivation

I grew up poor.

My grandmother used to obtain EBT food cards and bought us bunch of SPAM, eggs, and white rice. We would always have some old kimchi.

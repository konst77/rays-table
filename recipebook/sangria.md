# Citrus Garden Sangria

On those golden-hour evenings when the air feels soft and your to-do list finally loosens its grip, this pitcher shows up like a friendly neighbor. It’s bright, not boozy; simple, not fussy; and it tastes like you remembered to enjoy today. We’ll keep the sweetness gentle (honey, not syrup) and the bubbles light—because Ray’s Table is about living your moment, not overpowering it.

## Instructions

1. **Build the base.** In a large pitcher, combine the orange and lemon slices, diced apple, and berries. Add honey (or maple) and muddle gently with a spoon until the fruit looks glossy.
2. **Pour & season.** Add the wine (or zero-proof base) and brandy if using. Squeeze in a wedge of orange and stir. Taste; add a little more honey if you prefer it sweeter.
3. **Rest.** Refrigerate **at least 30 minutes** (up to 4 hours) so the fruit can share its secrets with the wine.
4. **Finish & serve.** Just before serving, add ice, top with sparkling water, and tuck in the mint. Ladle into glasses, making sure everyone gets fruit.

## Tips & Variations

- **Lighter, brighter:** Swap half the wine for **unsweetened pomegranate or grape juice** for a softer sip.
- **Rosé garden:** Use rosé, add 1 cup sliced peaches, and finish with basil instead of mint.
- **Not too sweet:** Star

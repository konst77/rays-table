# Japanese Curry with Beef Stew Base

When the day’s been loud, this pot is the quiet answer: soften onions, brown a few cubes of beef, and let time turn simple things into something you can breathe with. We keep the flavor classic—mildly sweet, gently spiced, and silky from the curry blocks—then brighten it with a little grated apple to make everything hum.

## Instructions

1. **Season & sear.** Pat the beef dry; season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a heavy pot over **medium-high**. Sear beef in batches until well browned, 2–3 minutes per side; transfer to a plate.
2. **Build the base.** Lower heat to **medium**. Add onions with a pinch of salt; cook 8–10 minutes, stirring, until soft and golden at the edges. Add garlic and ginger; cook 30 seconds.
3. **Deglaze & simmer.** Return beef and any juices. Add stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire, and grated apple. Scrape up browned bits. Bring to a simmer, cover partially, and cook **45–60 minutes**, until the beef is tender.
4. **Veg time.** Add carrots and potatoes; simmer **15–20 minutes** more, until just tender.
5. **Finish with curry.** Turn heat **low**. Stir in curry roux blocks a few pieces at a time until dissolved and the sauce is glossy and thick. Balance with honey/sugar, plus salt and pepper to taste. If using, stir in peas for 1–2 minutes.
6. **Serve.** Spoon over warm rice and top with pickles if you have them. Breathe. Eat.

## Tips & Variations

- **Instant Pot:** Sear beef and onions on *Sauté*. Add stock/seasonings (skip potatoes/carrots). Pressure cook **25 minutes**, quick release; add potatoes/carrots and pressure cook **5 minutes** more. Switch to *Sauté (Low)* and dissolve roux.
- **Beef swaps:** Chicken thighs (simmer ~25–30 min total) or firm tofu + mushrooms (simmer 10–15 min).
- **Veg forward:** Add kabocha squash or cauliflower in the last 10–12 minutes.
- **Spice level:** Mix mild and hot roux blocks to taste; add a dash of garam masala or curry powder at the end for lift.

## Make-Ahead & Storage

- **Next-day magic:** Like all stews, flavor deepens overnight. Cool, cover, and refrigerate up to **4 days**.
- **Freeze:** Up to **2 months** (potatoes can soften; swap in par-cooked carrots and add fresh potatoes when reheating if texture matters).
- **Reheat:** Low heat on the stovetop with a splash of water to loosen.

## Serve With

- Steamed rice, quick cucumber salad, or shredded cabbage with lemon.
- A soft-boiled egg and a few green onion rings for extra comfort.

> *Ray’s Table note:* Keep it simple, keep it kind—this is dinner that takes the edge off the day.

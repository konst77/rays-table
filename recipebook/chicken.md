# Chicken Boil

On weeknights when I want dinner to feel like a deep breath, I reach for a small pot and a small plan. Three-quarters of a pound of chicken thighs go in—just enough for two bowls and tomorrow’s quiet lunch. I knot a green onion like a little ribbon and toss it in with five smacked cloves of garlic and four coins of ginger. Two cups of water follow with a quarter-cup of aji mirin, the kind of gentle sweetness that makes a kitchen smell like someone thought ahead.

The simmer is unhurried. The chicken turns tender, the broth goes from clear to sunlit, and the garlic softens into something polite. I skim once, maybe twice, but mostly I let it be. This is the kind of pot that doesn’t ask for much—just a low flame and ten quiet minutes to gather itself.

When it’s ready, I fish out the onion ribbon and ginger, ladle the broth over rice, and slice the chicken right on top so the steam does the talking. A pinch of salt, maybe a splash of soy if it’s been that kind of day. It’s simple, healthy, and friendly—flavors that meet you where you are. And as the table settles, I remember why I love this: a small pot, a short list, and a moment you can actually taste.

## Instructions

1. Throw in all the ingredients in the pot.
2. Bring the pot to a boil.
3. Spoon out the gunks from the bloods.
4. Reduce the heat to medium-low, set the timer for 12 minutes.
5. Cover with a small lid to let the air out, but keeping the flavor in.
6. Once the timer goes off, get rid of the ginger and green onion.
7. You can boil more to the soup with the garlic for extra soup dishes.
8. Cut up the chicken and serve.


## Tips & Variations

- Broth Usage: I always use this broth for extra soup or as cooking sidekick. I will include more ideas later in the future.
- Serving tips: Simple trick is to serve with rice. However, I also make a noodle soup dish with extra veggies.
- Cooking tip: Fresh chicken may enhance the texture of the meat, but I usually freeze them after I pack them in a ziplock bags. Costco will make about 8 bags with two chicken thighs per serving, just for $25.
